# Park Elementary School
360 E Blithedale Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941

Mill Valley’s Park School was originally constructed in 1906. The PWA significantly expanded the school in 1939:

“A school bond issue ($55,000) was passed in 1938, which permitted the securing of $45,000 already pledged by the Public Works Administration (PWA). The school board hired Walter C. Falch, who designed Mill Valley City Hall [a PWA project] as the architect for the project. Peter Sartorio proposed the winning bid of $86,759 for the construction contract. The new V-shaped edifice, with an auditorium at its apex and wings extending back from both sides, was said to be one of the most up-to-date schools in the Bay Area.  It opened in September 1939 with six full classrooms, two empty classrooms, a health and dental observation room, a music room, principal’s office, and office of the Superintendent.”   (www.mvhistory.org)
